```

---

## Containerized Execution

### Container Setup
The project includes an optimized container configuration for production deployments.

---

#### 1. Build the Container

```
podman build -t cifar10-trainer .
# or using Docker
docker build -t cifar10-trainer .
```

---

#### 2. Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

If you use **MLflow tracking**, create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:

```
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://your-mlflow-server.com
MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=your-username
MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=your-password
```
---

#### 3. Run the Training Pipeline

With default configuration (`conf/config.yaml`):

```
podman run --rm --env-file .env cifar10-trainer
# or
docker run --rm --env-file .env cifar10-trainer
```

With a custom number of epochs and model type (e.g., 10 epochs using ResNet):

```
podman run --rm --env-file .env cifar10-trainer 10 resnet
```

---

#### 4. Optional: Mount Volumes to Persist Outputs

To preserve models, logs, or dataset files across container runs:

```
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/app/models \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  cifar10-trainer
```

---

#### Notes

- The `run.sh` script is the container entrypoint and supports optional CLI arguments:
  - `$1` → Number of training epochs
  - `$2` → Model type (`resnet`, `efficientnet`, `vit`, etc.)
- Datasets are automatically downloaded at runtime by the dataloader.
- The container is based on a lightweight Python 3.12 slim image for faster build and lower vulnerability surface.
- MLflow credentials and tracking server should be passed via environment variables for security.

## 4. EDA Summary & Impact

### Class Balance

The CIFAR-10 training dataset is **perfectly balanced**:

```
Class       | Samples
------------|--------
airplane    | 5000
automobile  | 5000
bird        | 5000
cat         | 5000
deer        | 5000
dog         | 5000
frog        | 5000
horse       | 5000
ship        | 5000
truck       | 5000
```

**Impact**:  
- No special handling for class imbalance (e.g., oversampling or weighting) is required.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1-score remain meaningful without class weighting.

---

### Image Dimensions

- All images are of fixed shape: **(32, 32, 3)** — height, width, and RGB channels.
- Small resolution means:
  - Fine details may be lost.
  - Model must learn to extract useful features from **low-resolution input**.
- Consistent dimensions simplify preprocessing and batch loading.

---

### Pixel Intensity Distribution

#### Red Channel:
- Slightly **left-skewed**, peak intensity around 120–130.
- Some clipping at 0 and 255 — likely from **overexposed/saturated regions**.

#### Green Channel:
- More balanced, peak around 130–140.
- Clipping at both ends — may reflect **shadows or lighting variations**.

#### Blue Channel:
- Peak intensity lower (~100–110), skewed toward dark values.
- Indicates **underexposure or low-light biases**.

**Interpretation**:
- Skewed intensity histograms and clipping suggest **image quality limitations**.
- Models must handle **low contrast**, **artifacts**, and **color imbalance**.

---

### Intra-Class Variation

Some classes like `bird`, `dog`, and `automobile` show **very high variation** in:

- **Pose** (e.g., flying vs. perching birds)
- **Background** (indoor/outdoor, clutter)
- **Scale** (close-up vs. full image)
- **Color & Texture** (bright, shiny, patterned vs. matte)

This increases task complexity and may require **strong feature extractors** to generalize.

---

### Data Augmentation Choices

To address intra-class variation and improve generalization, the following augmentations are applied:

| Augmentation              | Reason                                                           |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RandomCrop` + padding    | Handles translation and object localization shifts               |
| `RandomHorizontalFlip`    | Mirrors pose (e.g., flipped cars or animals)                     |
| `ColorJitter`             | Adjusts brightness/contrast to handle varied lighting            |
| `RandomRotation`          | Compensates for rotational variance in object orientation        |
| `RandomAffine`            | Adds mild geometric distortions (scale/shift)                    |
| `RandomErasing` (Cutout)  | Encourages robustness to occlusions or missing patches           |

**Impact**:
- Enhances model robustness to real-world variance.
- Mitigates overfitting on low-quality or repeated patterns.
- Encourages learning **position- and lighting-invariant features**.

---

### Proposed Model Selection based on EDA

EDA insights directly influence architecture choices:

- **ResNet** offers a strong balance of spatial feature learning and regularization.
- **EfficientNet** is suited for handling **low-resolution images efficiently**.
- **Vision Transformers** (ViTs) can learn **global context** from varied intra-class examples.
---

## 5. Preprocessing Steps Explanation

The preprocessing pipeline is designed to condition CIFAR-10 images for optimal model performance. It includes both dataset-specific normalization and model-specific resizing, with additional augmentations during training.

---

### Model-Aware Transform Configuration

Transformations are dynamically selected based on the chosen model architecture:

| Model Type             | Input Size | Normalization (Mean, Std)                   |
|------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Pretrained (ImageNet)  | 224×224    | `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]` |
| Custom / Non-pretrained| 32×32      | `[0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465]`, `[0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010]` |

> Pretrained models like **ResNet**, **EfficientNet**, and **ViT** expect ImageNet-style normalization and higher-resolution inputs (`224×224`), while non-pretrained models (if added) use native CIFAR-10 stats and resolution (`32×32`).

---

### Training Transformations

During training, **data augmentation** is applied to increase dataset variability and improve generalization:

| Transformation            | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Resize(input_size)`      | Ensures images match expected input dimensions                         |
| `RandomCrop(input_size, padding=4)` | Simulates translation, helps with spatial variance               |
| `RandomHorizontalFlip()`  | Handles mirrored images (e.g., animals/vehicles facing opposite ways)  |
| `ColorJitter()`           | Adds brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue randomness              |
| `RandomRotation(10°)`     | Introduces small rotational variance                                   |
| `ToTensor()`              | Converts PIL images to normalized PyTorch tensors                      |
| `RandomErasing(p=0.2)`    | Simulates occlusion, improving robustness to missing object parts      |
| `Normalize(mean, std)`    | Normalizes color channels based on dataset or ImageNet distribution    |

> These augmentations **do not apply** during evaluation or testing.

---

### Validation/Test Transformations

During evaluation and testing, only minimal preprocessing is performed:

| Transformation         | Purpose                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Resize(input_size)`   | Standardizes image dimensions            |
| `ToTensor()`           | Converts to PyTorch tensor               |
| `Normalize(mean, std)` | Aligns input statistics with model expectations |

---

### Data Loading Strategy

The dataset is split using a `val_ratio` (default: **10%** of training set):

- `train_dataset`: Receives augmentation-heavy transforms.
- `val_dataset`: Shares same base dataset, but uses **non-augmented** test-style transforms.
- `test_dataset`: Separate CIFAR-10 test split with standardized transforms.

> The split is deterministic using a fixed random seed (`manual_seed(42)`) to ensure reproducibility.

---

### Raw Dataset Access for EDA

For visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), raw CIFAR-10 datasets (without any transforms) can be loaded via:

```python
from src.data_loader import load_raw_cifar10
train_set, test_set = load_raw_cifar10()
```

This is useful for inspecting image quality, pixel distributions, or intra-class variation.

## 6. Model Architectures Chosen & Rationale

### Model Comparison for CIFAR-10 Classification

| Model               | Architecture Type | Parameters (M) | Distinctive Features                                                  | Suitability for CIFAR-10 Task                                            |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ResNet-50           | CNN               | ~25.6          | Residual connections help gradient flow in deep networks              | Strong baseline, well-balanced accuracy/speed, robust to small images    |

   - Significantly fewer parameters compared to VGG-16 (~25M vs ~138M) and better training efficiency.
   - Better performance than older CNNs like VGG and MobileNetV2 in terms of accuracy and depth handling due to residual connections.
   - More widely tested on small-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10 making it a reliable and robust baseline.

2. **EfficientNet-B0**
   - Offers better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to DenseNet-121 and MobileNetV2.
   - Chosen over heavier models like Swin Transformer for environments with limited compute.
   - Compound scaling makes it adaptable and performant despite its small parameter size (~5M), which is ideal for faster experimentation.

3. **Vision Transformer (ViT-Base)**
   - Selected over ViT-Tiny for its higher capacity and superior results on larger and more diverse datasets.
   - Offers a fundamentally different approach from CNNs, capturing long-range dependencies using attention mechanisms.
   - Chosen for its potential to generalize well with sufficient augmentation — a strong contrast to the locality bias of CNNs like ResNet or EfficientNet.

## 7. Evaluation Metrics & Results Comparison

Here we evaluate each of the models on the training and test datasets.

### 7.1 Training Metrics

#### 7.1.1 ResNet-50 

![Resnet Training](images/resnet_training.png "Resnet Training")

| Model           | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score (Weighted) | Val Loss |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| ResNet-50         | 79.16        | 0.7913               | 0.6227   |


**1. Loss Over Epochs**
- Both **training** and **validation loss** show a consistent downward trend.
- The gap between training and validation loss is minimal, suggesting **low overfitting**.
- Smooth convergence indicates **stable optimization**.

**2. Accuracy Over Epochs**
- Training and validation accuracies **rise steadily**, reaching **~78–79%**.
- The accuracy curves are tightly aligned, showing the model **generalizes well** to unseen data.
- Minor improvements toward the later epochs — the model might be close to plateauing.

**3. F1 Score Over Epochs**
- F1 scores for training and validation also **closely track each other**, indicating balanced performance across classes.
- Final validation F1 is near **0.8**, which is consistent with the expected class balance and good model performance.

#### Overall Remarks

- ResNet-50 is performing **robustly** and not overfitting.
- Validation accuracy surpassing training slightly could be due to **batch normalization statistics** or **training noise**.

#### 7.1.2 EfficientNet-B0

![EfficientNet Training](images/efficientnet_training.png "EfficientNet Training")

#### 7.1.3

| Model           | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score (Weighted) | Val Loss |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| EfficientNet-B0  | 79.00        | 0.7892               | 0.6286   |

**1. Loss Over Epochs**
- **Training loss** decreases steadily and smoothly across epochs, indicating stable learning.
- **Validation loss** follows a similar downward trend and is consistently **lower than training loss**, which suggests:
  - The model is **not overfitting**.
  - Regularization or augmentation is effective.
- The convergence flattens slightly toward the end — suggesting more training might still yield incremental improvements.

**2. Accuracy Over Epochs**
- **Training accuracy** starts around ~58% and gradually increases to ~77%.
- **Validation accuracy** is consistently **higher** than training accuracy (ending around ~79%):
  - This is somewhat unusual, but can happen due to:
    - **Strong data augmentation** during training (makes training harder).
    - **Simpler validation set** or easier examples.
  - Suggests the model **generalizes well** and hasn't memorized the training data.
- Curve is still rising — additional epochs might push performance a little higher.

**3. F1 Score Over Epochs**
- Both **training and validation F1 scores** increase over time, ending near ~0.76–0.78.
- The F1 curve follows the accuracy curve closely — which is expected on balanced datasets like CIFAR-10.
- Indicates that the model performs well across all classes without major imbalance issues.

### Overall Remarks

- The EfficientNet model shows **strong generalization performance**, with validation metrics consistently outperforming training — likely due to effective regularization or augmentation strategies.
- There are **no signs of overfitting**, and the upward trend in both accuracy and F1 score suggests that **further training could still improve results modestly**.

#### 7.1.3 Vision Transformer (ViT)

![Vision Transformer Training](images/vit_training.png "Vision Transformer Training")

| Model           | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score (Weighted) | Val Loss |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| Vision Transformer (ViT)          | 95.08        | 0.9508               | 0.1463   |

**1. Loss Over Epochs**
- **Train Loss** decreased sharply in the first few epochs and continued a smooth downward trend, indicating stable convergence.
- **Validation Loss** also decreased but plateaued slightly after epoch 4–5, suggesting diminishing returns or nearing optimal performance.

**2. Accuracy Over Epochs**
- **Training Accuracy** rapidly reached above 95% within a few epochs.
- **Validation Accuracy** closely tracks training accuracy with only a slight gap, indicating minimal overfitting and strong generalization.

**3. F1 Score Over Epochs**
- Both **Train** and **Validation F1 Scores** climbed above 0.95 quickly and plateaued smoothly.
- The high F1 score across both sets implies the model maintains balance across class predictions, with low false positives/negatives.

#### Observations
- The model converged efficiently within the first 5 epochs.
- Minimal overfitting observed, with validation curves tracking training curves closely.
- Excellent performance — both accuracy and F1 scores remain consistently high.


#### 7.1.4 Summary of training results

| Model           | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score (Weighted) | Val Loss |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| ResNet-50         | 79.16        | 0.7913               | 0.6227   |
| EfficientNet-B0  | 79.00        | 0.7892               | 0.6286   |
| Vision Transformer (ViT)          | 95.08        | 0.9508               | 0.1463   |

Overall, the Vision Transformer exhibited the best training results with validation accuracy of 95% and F1-score of 0.95.

Given the Vision Transformer (ViT) strong performance, visualizing its t-SNE embeddings can provide valuable insight into how effectively it separates the different classes in feature space:

![vit_tsne_embeddings](images/vit_tsne_embeddings.png "vit_tsne_embeddings")

Based on the t-SNE plot, the ViT model demonstrates strong class separation in the 2D embedding space. Most clusters are compact and well-separated, indicating that the model has learned meaningful representations. This likely contributes to its high validation accuracy of 95% and F1-score of around 0.95.

For example, classes such as automobile, truck, and ship form distinct, tight clusters. However, some overlap is observed between cat and dog but is expected given their visual similarity.

Notably, the "bird" class appears to split into two well-separated clusters. This may reflect substantial intra-class variation, such as differences in bird species, poses, or backgrounds. Despite being labeled under a single class, the model may have internally learned subgroup representations based on these visual distinctions.

Here, we examine Grad-CAM visualizations to understand which regions of the images the Vision Transformer (ViT) model focuses on when making its predictions. 

![vit_gradcam_grid](images/vit_gradcam_grid.png "vit_gradcam_grid")

Overall, the Grad-CAM visualizations suggest that the ViT model generally focuses on the relevant regions of the images — primarily the objects themselves rather than the background. However, for certain classes such as cat and deer, the attention appears to be concentrated on a relatively small portion of the object, which may indicate a reliance on class-specific features or biases in the training data.

### 7.2 Final Evaluation on Test Set

#### 7.2.1 Evaluation Metrics

The following table summarizes the test performance of the three models evaluated:

| Model             | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score | Loss   |
|------------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| ResNet-50         | 79.88        | 0.7985   | 0.6136 |
| EfficientNet-B0   | 78.92        | 0.7887   | 0.6390 |
| Vision Transformer (ViT) | 95.09        | 0.9509   | 0.1545 |

**Key Observations:**
- The **Vision Transformer** outperforms both ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B0 by a wide margin across all metrics, especially in accuracy and F1 score.
- Its performance reinforces the **effectiveness of self-attention** mechanisms in modeling global dependencies — particularly valuable for image classification.
- Both **ResNet** and **EfficientNet** show similar performance to each other, with ResNet slightly ahead in all metrics.

Below are the confusion matrices for each model, offering a detailed look at per-class predictions and misclassifications:

#### 7.2.2 Prediction Samples

Here are samples of correctly and incorrectly classified samples from the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model's predictions:

![VIT Predictions](images/vit_predictions_grid.png "VIT Predictions")

Among the incorrect predictions, most are semantically close — vehicles were often misclassified as other vehicles, and animals as other animals. One notable exception is the bottom-right case, where a ship was incorrectly predicted as a cat.
